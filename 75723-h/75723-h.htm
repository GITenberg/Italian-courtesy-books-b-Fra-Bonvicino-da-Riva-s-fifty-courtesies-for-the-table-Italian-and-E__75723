<div class="sidenote" id="heading1">EARLY REFINEMENT IN ITALY.</div>

<p>In connection with the many samples of English and some French
and Latin Courtesy-Books which the pains of other Editors have set
before the members of the Early English Text Society, I have been
asked to do something to exhibit what Italian literature has to show
for itself in the same line. The request is one which I gladly close
with; only cautioning the reader at starting that he must not expect
to find in my brief essay any deep or exhaustive knowledge of the
subject, or anything beyond specimens of the works under consideration,
picked out one here and one there. Italy, it is tolerably well
known, was, together with Provence, in the forefront of civilization—or
‘civility,’ as it might here be more aptly phrased—in the middle
ages; and I should not be surprised to learn that, in the refinements
of life and niceties of method, the Italy of the thirteenth century,
as traceable in her Courtesy-Books, was quite on a par with the
France or Germany<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of the fourteenth, or the England of the fifteenth,
and so progressively on. This, however, is a matter which I
must leave to be determined by more diligent and more learned researches
than my own. The materials for the comparison are now,
to some extent, fairly before the editing and reading members of our
Society.</p>

<p>As regards date, at all events, Italy is greatly in advance. What
is the date of the earliest French Courtesy-Book included in our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
series? Not far, I presume, from the close of the fourteenth century.
What of the earliest English one? About 1450. Against
these we can set an Italian Courtesy-Book—or rather a Courtesy section
of an Italian book—dating about 1265. Of a date prior to this
(the birth-year of Dante), there is little of either prose or poetry in
Italian.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading2">BRUNETTO LATINI.</div>

<p>The author of our specimen is a man illustrious in the literature
of Italy, though comparatively little read for some centuries past—Brunetto
Latini; remembered chiefly among miscellaneous readers as
the preceptor of Dante, and as consigned by that affectionate but
unaccommodating pupil to a very ugly circle of his Hell. There, if
we may believe the ‘Poet of Rectitude,’ Ser Brunetto, with a ‘baked
aspect,’ is at this moment unremittingly walking under an unremitting
rain of fire: were he to pause, he would remain moveless for a
century, and the torture of the flames would persecute him in aggravated
proportion. On the same authority (which it is futile to fence
with), I am compelled to say that Brunetto is the last person from
whom one need wish to learn the practice, or as a consequence the
theory, of modern or European morals.</p>

<p>However, Brunetto seems to have considered that he had a gift
that way. Both his leading works may be termed moral-scientific
treatises. The longer of the two, the <i>Tesoro</i>, was written in French
prose, and is much of a compilation from classic authors in some sections.
It had hitherto only been preserved to the public in an old
Italian translation, but quite recently the French text has been printed.
Sacred, profane, and natural history, geography, oratory, politics,
and morals, are the main subject-matter of this encyclopædic labour;
than which probably no contemporary produced anything more widely
learned, according to the standard of that age. The <i>Tesoretto</i> is a
shorter performance, written in Italian verse; shorter, yet still of
substantial length, numbering, even in its extant incomplete state,
22 sections or ‘<i>capitoli</i>.’ This is the work upon which I shall draw
for our first specimen of an Italian Courtesy-Book. Something bearing
upon the like questions might also be gleaned from the <i>Tesoro</i>,
but, as that is properly a French book, I leave it aside.</p>

<p>The <i>Tesoretto</i> sets forth that its author, being at Roncesvalles on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
his return from an embassy in Spain, received the bad news of the
battle of Montaperti. Getting astray in a forest,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he finds himself in
the presence of no less a personage than Dame Nature, who proceeds
to give him practical and theoretic demonstrations on all sorts of lofty
subjects. She then tells him to explore the forest, where he would
find Philosophy, the four Moral Virtues (Prudence, Temperance, Fortitude,
and Justice), Love, Fortune, and Over-reaching (Baratteria).
He follows her instructions, searching out these personages from
Philosophy on to Love: the four Virtues are attended by many ladies,
among whom Brunetto specifies particularly Liberality, <i>Courtesy</i>,
Good-faith, and Valour. After his interview with Love, he resolves
to reconcile himself with God, and makes a full confession at Montpélier.
Having received absolution, he does not return after Fortune
and Over-reaching, but goes back to the forest, and thence reaches
the summit of Mount Olympus. Here he sees Ptolemy, who is about
to harangue him, when suddenly the <i>Tesoretto</i> comes to an end. Its
best editor, the Abate Zannoni, supposes that the concluding portion
of the poem was written, but has been lost to posterity.</p>

<p>A few words must be added as to the incidents of the author’s
life. He was born (probably) not much later than 1220 in the
Florentine state, and died in 1294. After the great defeat of the
Guelphs by the Ghibellines at Montaperti in 1260, Brunetto, with
others of the Guelph party, which was almost uninterruptedly uppermost
in Florence, found it expedient to emigrate from that capital.
He went to Paris, and there wrote both the <i>Tesoro</i> and <i>Tesoretto</i>.
Towards 1265 he was again re-established in his native country, exercising
with great credit his profession of a notary, and also (by or
before the year 1273) holding the post of secretary to the Commune
of Florence. He became, as already mentioned, the preceptor of
Dante. As the pupil has damned him to all time at any rate, if not
in effect to all eternity, for one offence, let us at least preserve some
memory of his countervailing merits, as set forth by Giovanni and
Filippo Villani. The former affirms that Brunetto ‘was the initiator
and master in refining the Florentines, and cultivating their use of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
language; and in regulating the justice and rule of our Republic according
to policy.’ And, according to Filippo, ‘Brunetto Latini was
by profession a philosopher, by occupation a notary, and of great
name and celebrity. He showed forth how much of rhetoric he
could add to the gifts of nature: a man, if it be permitted to say so,
worthy of being reckoned along with those skilled and ancient
orators. He was facetious, learned, and acute, and abounded in certain
pleasantries of speech; yet not without gravity, and the reserve
of modesty, which bespoke a most cordial acceptance for his humour:
of agreeable discourse, which often moved to laughter. He was
obliging and decorous, and by nature serviceable, reserved, and
grave; and most happy in the habit of all virtues, had he been
wisely able to endure with a more steadfast mind the outrages of his
infuriated country.’</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading3">EXTRACT FROM B. LATINI'S <i>TESORETTO</i>.</div>

<p>The <i>Tesoretto</i> is of course a mine of curiosities of various kinds,
tempting to the literary explorer. To call it distinctly a fine poem, or
even the performance of a strictly poetic mind, might be the exaggeration
of an enthusiast; but at all events it contains much sound
matter well put, and by no means destitute of entertainment. The
section that falls in best with our present purpose is the speech
assigned to Lady Courtesy: I present it in its entirety.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading4">BONVICINO DA RIVA.</div>

<p>We now pass from Florence to Lombardy—from Ser Brunetto
Latini to Fra Bonvicino da Riva—from the lawyer and official to the
friar and professor. The poem of Fra Bonvicino, <i>The Fifty Courtesies
for the Table</i>, will be our principal <i>pièce de résistance</i>, and presented
accordingly in its own garnishing of old Italian as well as in
English. Not that it is by any means the best or most important
piece of work that we have to bring forward; but its rarity, its dialectic
interest for students of old Italian, and its precision and detail
with regard to one of the essentials of courtesy—the art of dining—give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
it exceptional value for our direct purpose. The poem is supposed
to have been written about 1290.</p>

<p>Unpolished as he is in poetic development, Fra Bonvicino is not
to be altogether slighted from a literary point of view. Tiraboschi
(<i>Storia della Letteratura Italiana</i>) believes that Bonvicino and one
other were the two sole verse-writers of the Lombard or Milanese
State in this opening period of Italian poesy; and Signor Biondelli,
whom we have to thank for the publication of Bonvicino’s production
after so many centuries of its hybernation in MS, can point to the
choiceness of the old Friar’s vocabulary. In one couplet that well-qualified
editor is able to find five expressions ‘which, for propriety
and purity, would even at the present day beseem the most careful of
writers;’ and hence he pronounces Bonvicino ‘the elegant writer of
his time.’ It should be understood, however, that the MS reproduced
by Signor Biondelli, and now again in the present volume,
gives but an inadequate idea of the primitiveness of Bonvicino’s own
actual idiom. Tiraboschi cites a harsher version of the first stanza
from an earlier MS then existing in the Library of Santa Maria Incoronata
in Milan, but which is now undiscoverable: the MS used
by Signor Biondelli is of a much later date, the fifteenth century. It
pertains to the Ambrosian Library in Milan.</p>

<p>Bonvicino belonged to the third order of the Friars named Umiliati,
and lived (as he himself informs us) in Legnano, a town of the
Milanese district. Hence he went to Milan, and became a distinguished
professor of grammar in the Palatine schools. The only other
poem of his published in Signor Biondelli’s volume<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> is <i>On the dignity
of the Glorious Virgin Mary</i>: but Tiraboschi specifies other productions
in verse—Dialogues in praise of Almsgiving, between the Virgin
and Satan, between the Virgin and the Sinner, between the Creator
and the Soul, between the Soul and the Body, between the Violet
and the Rose, between the Fly and the Ant; also the Legends of Job
and of St Alexius; and various works in Latin, of which some have
been published.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading6">SUMMARY OF BONVICINO.</div>

<p>As far as I know (though I cannot affect to speak with authority)
this poem by Fra Bonvicino, and those by Francesco da Barberino
of which we shall next take cognisance, are considerably the oldest
still extant Courtesy-Books (expressly to be so termed) of Christianized
Europe;<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> except one, partly coming under the same definition,
which has been mentioned to me by a well-read friend, Dr
Heimann (of University College), but of which I have no direct
personal knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> This also, though written in the German
language, is the production of an Italian. It is entitled <i>Der Wälsche
Gast</i> (<i>the Italian Guest</i>), and dates about 1210. The author’s name
is given as Tomasin von Zirclaria, born in Friuli. The book supplies
various rules of etiquette, in a very serious and well-intentioned tone,
as I am informed.—Fra Bonvicino would, on the ground of his
antiquity alone, be well deserving of study. His precepts moreover
(with comparatively few exceptions) cannot even yet be called obsolete,
though some of them are unsophisticated to the extent of being
superfluous. In order that the reader may see in one <i>coup d’œil</i> the
whole of this curious old monument I subjoin a classified abridgment
of the injunctions:—</p>

<p class="center">1. <i>Moral and Religious.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To think of the poor first of all.</p>

<p>To remember grace before meat.</p>

<p>To eat enough, and not too much.</p>

<p>Not to get drunk.</p>

<p>To pass over for the time any cause of quarrel.</p>

<p>To say grace after meat.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">2. <i>Practical Rules still fairly operative.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To offer water for washing the hands before dinner.</p>

<p>Not to plump into a seat at table at haphazard.</p>

<p>To sit at table decorously and in good humour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>Not to tilt oneself forward on the table.</p>

<p>Not to gorge or bolt one’s food.</p>

<p>To subordinate talking to eating.</p>

<p>Not to drink with one’s mouth full.</p>

<p>To remain seated at table, even though fresh guests should arrive.</p>

<p>Not to suck at solid food eaten with a spoon.</p>

<p>To use up one’s bread.</p>

<p>To abstain from raising objections to the dinner.</p>

<p>Not to scrutinize one’s neighbour’s plate.</p>

<p>To cut bread as it comes, not in all sorts of ways.</p>

<p>To carve for the ladies.</p>

<p>To give the guests prime cuts.</p>

<p>To make the guests thoroughly welcome, without oppressive
urgencies.</p>

<p>To abstain at dinner from stroking cats and dogs.</p>

<p>Not to speak with one’s mouth full.</p>

<p>To abstain from imparting bad news at dinner.</p>

<p>To keep down any symptoms of pain or illness.</p>

<p>To avoid calling attention to anything disagreeable which may
accidentally be in the dishes.</p>

<p>The attendants to hold the dishes by their rims.</p>

<p>Not to hand round the bowl by its upper edge.</p>

<p>Not to overload the dishes, goblets, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Not to hurry through with one’s eating, so that others, who are
left behind, would feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>To wash hands and drink the best wine after dinner.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">3. <i>Rules equally true and primitive.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Not to tilt one’s legs on the table between-whiles.</p>

<p>To turn aside if one sneezes or coughs.</p>

<p>Not to set down before the guests utensils fresh from the kitchen.</p>

<p>The attendants to be clean—not to spit, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To blow one’s nose on ‘foot-cloths,’ not through the fingers.</p>

<p>Not to scratch at one’s head or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Not to pick one’s teeth with the fingers.</p>

<p>Not to lick one’s fingers clean.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p class="center">4. <i>Rules which may be regarded as over-punctilious or obsolete.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Not to sit at table with one’s legs crossed.</p>

<p>To offer the cup to others only when they want it. (The rules
as to drinking seem throughout to contemplate that two or more
guests are using one cup or vessel.)</p>

<p>To use both hands in drinking.</p>

<p>Never to decline the cup when another offers it, but to drink no
more than one wishes. (This rule still has its analogue at tables
where the custom lingers of requesting ‘the pleasure of taking wine
with’ some one else.)</p>

<p>Not to rummage about in the dish from which one is eating along
with others.</p>

<p>Not to dip bread into the wine of which one is drinking along
with others.</p>

<p>To suspend eating while a man of importance is drinking.</p>

<p>To postpone drinking till the man of importance has finished.</p>

<p>Not to speak to a man who is in the act of drinking. (This rule
seems to contemplate ‘potations pottle-deep,’ such as engage all
one’s energies for some little while together: for a mere modern sip
at a wine-glass such a rule would be superfluous.)</p>

<p>To retain one’s spoon when one’s plate is removed for another
help, (<i>One</i> spoon, it may be inferred, is to last all through the
meal, serving as a fork.)</p>

<p>Not to eat an excessive quantity of bread with the viands.</p>

<p>Not to re-place one’s knife in its sheath prematurely. (It may
be presumed that each guest brings his own knife.)</p>

</div>

<p>The reader who considers these rules in their several categories,
and with due allowance for difference of times, manners, and ‘properties,’
will, I think, agree with me in seeing that the essentials of
courtesy at table in Lombardy in the thirteenth century, and in
England in the nineteenth, are, after all, closely related; and that,
while some of our Friar’s tutorings would now happily be supererogatory,
and others are inapplicable to present dining conveniences,
not one is ill-bred in any correct use of that word. The details of
etiquette vary indefinitely: the sense of courtesy is substantially one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
and the same. In Fra Bonvicino’s manual, it appears constantly in
its genuine aspect, and prompted by its truest spirit—not so much
that of personal correctness, each man for his own credit, as of
uniform consideration for others.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading7">FRANCESCO DA BARBERINO.</div>

<p>The same is eminently the case with some of the precepts given
by our next author, Francesco da Barberino. Nothing, for instance,
can go beyond the true <i>rationale</i> of courtesy conveyed in the following
injunction<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> (which we must not here degrade from its grace of
Tuscan speech and verse):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">‘Colli minor sì taci,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E prendi il loco che ti danno; e pensa</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Che, per far qui difensa,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Faresti lor, per tuo vizio, villani.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or this:<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">‘E credo che fa male</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Colui che taglia essendo a suo maggiore:</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Chè non v’ è servitore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">S’ el non dimanda prima la licenza.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Indeed, I think that the tone prevalent throughout Barberino’s
maxims of courtesy on all sorts of points is fairly to be called exquisite.
Our extract from him brings us (it may be well to remember)
into the closest contact with the social usages which Dante
in his youth must have been cognisant of and conforming to; for, in
passing from Bonvicino to Barberino, we have passed from Lombardy
to Tuscany—the latter poet being a native of the Val d’Elsa, in the
same district as Boccaccio’s birth-place, Certaldo. The date assigned
to Barberino’s work, the <i>Documenti d’Amore</i>, is just about the same
as that of Bonvicino’s, or from 1290 to 1296. Yet I apprehend we
must receive this early date with some hesitation. In 1290 Barberino
was but twenty-six years of age; whereas the <i>Documenti d’Amore</i>,
a lengthy and systematic treatise on all kinds of moral and
social duties and proprieties, seems to be rich with the hoarded experience
of years. That so young a man should even have sketched
out for himself a work of such axiomatic oracularity seems <i>à priori</i>
unlikely, though one has to accept the fact on authority: that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
should towards that age have completed the poem as we now possess
it appears to me barely compatible with possibility. His other long
poem, still more singular on the like account, is referred to nearly
the same date. I observe in it, however, one passage (Part 6) which
<i>must</i> have been written after 1308, and probably after 1312. It
refers to a story which had been narrated to Barberino ‘one time
that he was in Paris.’ Now his journey on a mission to Provence
and France began in 1309, and ended in 1313.</p>

<p>I shall here give place to my brother, and extract <i>verbatim</i> the
notice of Barberino contained in his book of translations, <i>The Early
Italian Poets</i>.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Francesco da Barberino: born 1264, died 1348.</p>

<p>‘With the exception of Brunetto Latini (whose poems are neither
very poetical nor well adapted for extract), Francesco da Barberino
shows by far the most sustained productiveness among the poets who
preceded Dante, or were contemporaries of his youth. Though born
only one year in advance of Dante, Barberino seems to have undertaken,
if not completed, his two long poetic treatises some years
before the commencement of the <i>Commedia</i>.</p>

<p>‘This poet was born at Barberino di Valdelsa, of a noble family,
his father being Neri di Ranuccio da Barberino. Up to the year of
his father’s death, 1296, he pursued the study of law chiefly in
Bologna and Padua; but afterwards removed to Florence for the same
purpose, and became one of the many distinguished disciples of
Brunetto Latini,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> who probably had more influence than any other
one man in forming the youth of his time to the great things they
accomplished. After this he travelled in France and elsewhere; and
on his return to Italy in 1313, was the first who, by special favour of
Pope Clement V., received the grade of Doctor of Laws in Florence.
Both as lawyer and as citizen, he held great trusts, and discharged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
them honourably. He was twice married, the name of his second
wife being Barna di Tano, and had several children. At the age of
eighty-four he died in the great plague of Florence. Of the two
works which Barberino has left, one bears the title of <i>Documenti
d’Amore</i>, literally <i>Documents<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> of Love</i>, but perhaps more properly
rendered as <i>Laws of Courtesy</i>; while the other is called <i>Del Reggimento
e dei Costumi delle Donne</i>,—<i>of the Government and Conduct
of Women</i>. They may be described, in the main, as manuals of good
breeding or social chivalry—the one for men, and the other for
women. Mixed with vagueness, tediousness, and not seldom with
artless absurdity, they contain much simple wisdom, much curious
record of manners, and (as my specimens show) occasional poetic
sweetness or power—though these last are far from being their most
prominent merits. The first-named treatise, however, has much
more of such qualities than the second, and contains moreover passages
of homely humour which startle by their truth, as if written
yesterday. At the same time, the second book is quite as well worth
reading, for the sake of its authoritative minuteness in matters which
ladies now-a-days would probably consider their own undisputed region,
and also for the quaint gravity of certain surprising prose anecdotes
of real life with which it is interspersed. Both these works
remained long unprinted; the first edition of the <i>Documenti d’Amore</i>
being that edited by Ubaldini in 1640, at which time he reports the
<i>Reggimento</i> &amp;c. to be only possessed by his age “in name and in desire.”
This treatise was afterwards brought to light, but never
printed till 1815. I should not forget to state that Barberino attained
some knowledge of drawing; and that Ubaldini had seen his
original MS of the <i>Documenti</i>, containing, as he says, skilful miniatures
by the author.</p>

<p>‘Barberino never appears to have taken a very active part in politics,
but he inclined to the Imperial and Ghibelline party. This
contributes with other things to render it rather singular that we find
no poetic correspondence or apparent communication of any kind between
him and his many great countrymen, contemporaries of his
long life, and with whom he had more than one bond of sympathy.
His career stretched from Dante, Guido Cavalcanti, and Cino da Pistoia,
to Petrarca and Boccaccio: yet only in one respectful but not
enthusiastic notice of him by the last-named writer (<i>Genealogia degli
Dei</i>) do we ever meet with an allusion to him by any of the greatest
men of his time. Nor in his own writings, as far as I remember, are
<i>they</i> ever referred to. His epitaph is said to have been written by
Boccaccio, but this is doubtful. On reviewing the present series, I
am sorry, on the whole, not to have included more specimens of Barberino;
whose writings, though not very easy to tackle in the mass,
would afford an excellent field for selection and summary.’</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>Thus far my brother. I will only add to his biographical details
that, at the very end of Francesco da Barberino’s life, he and one of
his sons were elected the Priori, or joint chief-magistrates of the Florentine
Republic; and that the Barberini who came to the papal
chair in 1623 as Urban VIII. was of the same family. His patronymic
is enshrined to many loose memories in the epigram ‘<i>Quod non
fecere Barbari fecere Barberini</i>.’ To all that my brother has said of
the qualities, and especially the merits, of Francesco, I cordially subscribe.
The <i>Documenti d’Amore</i> is really a most capital book,—I
should suppose, unsurpassed of its kind, and also in its interest
for students of the early mediæval manners, and modes of thought.
Its diction is remarkably condensed—(Italian scholars say that it
shows strong traces of the author’s Provençal studies and predilections)—and
it is proportionately stiff work to hasty readers. Those
who will peruse it deliberately, and weigh its words, find many
niceties of laconism, and much terse and sententious good sense as
well—lengthy as is the entire book. This is indeed no slight
matter—twelve sections, and something like 8500 lines. It is exactly
the sort of work to elicit and to account for editorial enthusiasm.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading8">THE DOCUMENTI D'AMORE.</div>

<p>I extract in full the stanzas bearing directly upon that which
(following the impulsion of Fra Bonvicino) has become our more
immediate subject—the Courtesies of the Table. The tone of society
which we find here is visibly in advance of the Lombard
Friar’s, though the express precepts of the two writers have a good
deal of general resemblance: the superiority in this respect is very
much the same as in the language. Barberino’s diction seems quite
worthy of a Tuscan contemporary of Dante, and his works are still
drawn upon as a ‘<i>testo di lingua</i>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>
<p>Before parting from the <i>Documenti d’Amore</i>, I will summarize a
few more of Barberino’s dicta on points of courtesy and demeanour
in general.</p>

<p>There are seven offences in speaking: 1. Prolixity; 2. Curtness;
3. Audacity; 4. Mauvaise Honte; 5. Stuttering; 6. Beating about
the bush; 7. Restlessness of gesture, and this is the least supportable
of all. Remedies against all these evils are assigned. For the
6th, as we are told, the (then) modern usage is to speak out what
you have to say with little or no proem. As to the 7th, the moving
about, as a child would do, the hands, feet, or head, or the using
action in speech, shows deficient firmness. See that you stand firm.
Yet all this is to be modified according to place, time, and the
auditory. (It is amusing to find the dignified Tuscan of the
thirteenth to fourteenth century reprobating that luxuriance of
gesture which is one of the first things to strike an English eye in
Italy down to our own day—more especially in the southern parts
of the country. To have striven to obey Barberino’s precept, under
pain of being pronounced bad company, must have proved hard lines
to some of his contemporaries and catechumens.)</p>

<p>If you chance into uncongenial company, take the first opportune
occasion for getting away, with some parting words that shall not
bewray your antipathy.</p>

<p>To casual companions speak on their own respective subjects; as
of God to the clergy, health to doctors, design to painters. ‘With
ladies of refinement and breeding, laud and uphold their honour and
state by pleasant stories not oftentimes told already. And, if any
one is contrary and froward, reply in excuse and defence; for it is
derogatory to contend against those the overcoming of whom is loss.’</p>

<p>If you come into the company of a great lord, or of persons who
are all your superiors, and if they invite you to speak, inquire what
the topic shall be. If you find nothing to say, wait for some one
else to start you; and at worst be silent. In such company, be
there no gesturing (again!).</p>

<p>If you are walking with a great lord in any country, conform in
a measure to the usages there prevalent.</p>

<p>Following your superior, be respectful; to your equal, complaisant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
and treat him as superior; and, even with your inferior,
tend towards the same line of conduct. This, however, does not
apply to your own servant. Better exceed than fall short in showing
respect to unknown persons. If your superior, in walking with you,
wants to have you by his side, go to his left as a general rule, so
that he may have the full use of his sword hand. If it rains, and
he has no cloak, offer him yours; and, even if he declines, you must
still dispense with it yourself. The like with your hat. Pay similar
attentions to your equal, or to one that is a little your inferior: and
even to your positive inferiors you must rather overdo courtesy than
fall short. Thus also with women: you must explore the way for
them, and attend on them, and in danger defend them with your
life.</p>

<p>In church, do not pray aloud, but silently.</p>

<p>Wait not to be saluted. Be first in saluting; but do not overdo
this, and never reiterate a salutation. Your own lord you must not
salute, unless he comes from afar. You should uncover to him:
then, if he is covered, cover again. Do not exceed in saluting an
intimate, but enter at once into conversation; and do not hug him,
unless he and you are indeed one.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Bow to ladies without much
speaking: and in towns ascertain the ordinary practice in such cases,
and observe it. If you see a female relative in your own town, she
being alone, or in company with only one person, <i>and if she is handsome</i>,
accost her as though she were not your relative, unless your
relationship is a fact known to the bystanders, (This is a master-touch:
and here is another, of a nearly similar sort)—</p>

<p>In serving a man of distinction, if you meet his wife, affect not
to observe her; and, if she gives you any commission to fulfil, don’t
show that it gratifies you.</p>

<p>The 16th ‘<i>Documento</i>’ sets forth ‘the method of making presents
so that the gift be acceptable.’ It is so admirable in point of
both sense and expression that I quote the original in a note, secure
that <i>that</i> will be a gift acceptable to all such readers of these pages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
as may be readers of Italian also.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> What can be more perfect than
the censure awarded to those who are in a chafe until, by reciprocating
any service rendered to them, they shall have wiped it out?</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Come before her.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The promise here is rich indeed, and the performance also is rich;
though it may fairly be said that various sections fall considerably
below one’s expectations, and some of them are jejune enough. But,
after every deduction has been made, the work fills a niche of its
own, and without competitor.</p>

<p>I add a few of the details most germane to our purpose.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A young girl should drink but little, and that diluted. She
must not loll at table, nor prop her arms thereon. Here she
should speak even less than at other times. The daughters of
Knights (Cavalier da Scudo), Judges, Physicians, or others of similar
condition, had better learn the art of cooking, though possibly circumstances
will not call upon them to put it in practice.</p>

<p>A Princess approaching the marriageable age should not go out to
church; as she ought, as far as possible, to avoid being seen about.
(The marriageable age, be it understood, is very early by Barberino’s
reckoning, being twelve years.) A woman should never go out alone.</p>

<p>An unmarried young lady had better wear a topaz, which is proved
by experience to be an antidote to carnal desire.</p>

<p>A Provençal gentleman, who was praising his wife for her extreme
simplicity in attire, was asked, ‘Why then does she comb her
hair?’ He replied: ‘To show that she is a woman, whose very
nature it is to be trim in person.’</p>

<p>A Lady’s-maid should not tell tales to her mistress of any peccadilloes
of the husband: still less should she report to the husband
anything against his wife, unless it be a grave and open misdoing.</p>

<p>The section concerning Nurses (Part 13) contains much curious
matter: especially as showing how much reliance was placed upon
swaddling and other details of infant management, for the improvement
of good looks, and correction of blemishes. Here we find also
that the system against which Rousseau waged such earnest war, of
mothers’ not suckling their own children, was already in full vigour
in Barberino’s time. He enters no protest against it; but does recommend
mothers to follow the more natural plan, if they can, and
so please God, and earn the children’s love.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>A she-Barber must not ogle or flirt with her customers, but attend
to her washes and razors. A Fruiteress must not put green leaves
with old fruits, nor the best fruits uppermost, to take her customers
in. A Landlady must not sell re-cooked victuals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>A shrew earns the stick sometimes; nor should that form of correction
be spared to women who gad about after fortune-tellers.</p>

<p>Beware of a Doctor who scrutinizes your pretty face more than
your symptoms. Also of a Tailor who wants to serve you gratis, or
who is over-officious in trying on your clothes: and beware still more
of a Tailor who is tremulous. If you go to any balls where men are
present, let it be by day, or at any rate with abundance of light.</p>

<p>The use of thick unguents is uncleanly, especially in hot weather;
it makes the teeth black, the lips green, and the skin prematurely old-looking.
Baths of soft water, not in excess, keep the skin young and
fresh: but those in which hot herbs are boiled scorch and blacken it.
Dark hair becomes lighter by being kept uncovered, especially in
moonlight.</p>

<p>‘Courtesy is liberal magnificence, which suffers not violence, nor
ingenuity, nor obligation, but pleases of itself alone.’</p>
</div>

<p>To these brief jottings I subjoin one extract of some length, descriptive
of the marriage-festivity of a Queen. To abridge its details
would be to strip it of its value: but I apprehend that some of these
details require to be taken <i>cum grano salis</i>, Barberino having allowed
himself a certain poetical license.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading10">SANDRO DI PIPPOZZO. GRAZIOLO DE’ BOMBAGLIOLI.
UGOLINO BRUCOLA.</div>

<p>Tiraboschi mentions a book which might perhaps be useful in
further illustrating Italian manners at the end of the 13th century:
but I have no direct knowledge of it,—a Treatise on the Governing
of a Family, written by Sandro di Pippozzo in 1299. A treatise on
Moral Virtues (<i>Sopra le Virtù Morali</i>) was composed by Graziolo de’
Bombaglioli, a Bolognese, in Italian verse, with a comment in Latin,
the date being about the middle of the 14th century; and was published
in 1642, being at that time mistakenly attributed to King
Robert of Naples. It is not a Courtesy-Book; but, referring back to
what has been said (on <a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>) regarding the definitions of nobility
given by Brunetto Latini, Dante, and Barberino, I may cite part of
what Bombaglioli says on the same subject:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Neither long-standing wealth nor blood confers nobility;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But virtue makes a man noble (<i>gentile</i>);</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And it lifts from a vile place</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A man who makes himself lofty by his goodness.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A third and older book, no doubt very much to our purpose, would
be one which Ubaldini (in his edition of Barberino’s <i>Reggimento</i>)
refers to as having been laid under contribution by that poet in compiling
his <i>Documenti d’Amore</i>—viz. a rhymed composition, in the
Romagnole dialect, on Methods of Salutation, by Ugolino Brucola<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
(or Bruzola). This work, again, is unknown to me; and, as I can
trace no mention of it even in Tiraboschi, a writer of most omnivorous
digestion, I infer that it may not improbably have perished.</p>

<p>Skipping therefore about a century and a quarter, within which
Italian literature was made for ever illustrious by the <i>Commedia</i> of
Dante, and the writings of Petrarca and Boccaccio, not to speak of
others, we come to the early 15th century, still in Florence.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading11">AGNOLO PANDOLFINI.</div>

<p>Agnolo Pandolfini wrote on the same subject as Sandro di
Pippozzo, the Governing of a Family (<i>Del Governo della Famiglia</i>).
He died in 1446, aged about 86; and the date of his treatise seems
to be towards 1425-30. This work must not be confounded with
one bearing the same title, frequently cited in the Dizionario della
Crusca, and which deals more particularly with morals and religion.
Pandolfini, both by birth and doings, was a very illustrious son of
Florence: in 1414, 1420, and 1431, he held the highest dignity of
the state, that of Gonfalonier of Justice. He opposed the banishment
of Cosmo de’ Medici, and was treated with distinguished honour by
that great though dangerous citizen on his return. His treatise
takes the form of a dialogue, wherein Agnolo holds forth <i>ore rotundo</i>
to his sons and grandsons. The old gentleman is indeed fearfully
oracular, and possessed with a fathomless belief in himself. He
writes well, and with plenty of good sense. His book is not, in the
straitest acceptation of the term, a Courtesy-Book, but rather a cross
between the moral and the prudential—a dissertation of Œconomics.
Here are some samples of his lore.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading12">THE GOVERNO DELLA FAMIGLIA.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To choose a house wherein one can settle comfortably for life is
a great consideration. A locality with good air and good wine
should be sought out: better to buy it than to rent it. The whole
family should have one roof, one entrance-door, one fire, and one
dining-table: this subserves the purposes both of affection and of
thrift.</p>

<p>The family and household should be well dressed. Even when
living a country life, they should keep on the town dress: good
cloth and cheerful colours, but without fancy-ornaments save for the
women.</p>

<p>The head of the family should commit to his wife the immediate
care of the household goods: men, however careful, should not be
poking and prying into every corner, and looking whether the
candles have too thick a wick. ‘It is well for every lady to know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
how to cook, and prepare all choice viands; to learn this from cooks
when they come to the house for banquets; to see them at work, ask
questions, learn, and bear in mind, so that, when guests come who
ought to be received with welcome, the ladies may know and order
all the best things—and so not have to send every time for cooks.
This cannot be done at a moment’s notice, and especially when one
is in the country, where good cooks are not to be had, and strangers
are more in the way of being asked. Not indeed that the lady is to
cook; but she should order, teach, and show the less skilful servants
to do everything in the best way, and make the best dishes suitable
to the season and the guests.’</p>

<p>‘I [the infallible Agnolo Pandolfini] always liked so to order the
household that, at whatever hour of day or night, there should
always be some one at home to look after all casualties that might
happen to the inmates. And I always kept in the house a goose
and a dog—wakeful animals, and, as we see, suspicious and attached;
so that, one of them rousing the other, and calling up the household,
the house might always be secure.’</p>

<p>Always buy of the best—food, clothes, &amp;c., &amp;c. ‘Good things
cost less than the not good.’</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading13">MATTEO PALMIERI.</div>

<p>That Agnolo Pandolfini was regarded as a great authority not
by himself alone is proved by the fact that Matteo Palmieri, the
author of a Dialogue on Civil Life (<i>Della Vita Civile</i>), makes him
the principal speaker. And this was perhaps even during Agnolo’s
lifetime: the assumed date of the colloquy being 1430 (very much
the same as that of Pandolfini’s own book), and the actual date of
composition being probably enough not many years later. Palmieri
was born in Florence in 1405, and died in 1475, honoured for conspicuous
integrity, and distinguished by many public employments.
The <i>Vita Civile</i> is regarded as his most important literary work.
The interlocutors, besides Pandolfini, are a Sacchetti and a Guicciardini.
The subject-matter is more grave and weighty than that of a
Courtesy-Book strictly so called, though we may dip into it for a
detail or two. The following is Palmieri’s own account of the work:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘The whole performance is divided into four books. In the 1st
the new-born boy is diligently conducted up to the perfect age of
man; showing by what nurture and according to what arts he should
prove more excellent than others. The following two books are
written concerning Uprightness; and express in what manner the
man of perfect age should act, in private and in public, according to
every moral virtue. Whence, in the former of these, Temperance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Fortitude, and Prudence, are treated of at large—also other virtues
comprised in these. The next is 3rd in order, and is all devoted to
Justice, which is the noblest part of men, and above all others necessary
for maintaining every well-ordered commonwealth. Wherefore
here is diffusely treated of Civil Justice; how people should conduct
themselves in peace; and how wars are managed; how, within the
city by those who hold the magistracies, and beyond the walls by
the public officials, the general well-being is provided for. The last
book alone is written concerning Utility, and provides for the plenty,
ornament, property, and abundant riches, of the whole body politic.
Then in the final portion, as last conclusion, is shown, not without
true doctrine, what is the state of the souls which in the world,
intent upon public good, have lived according to the precepts of life
here set forth by us; in reward whereof they have been by God received
into heaven, to be happy eternally in glory with his saints.’</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading14">THE VITA CIVILE.</div>

<p>Palmieri would have boys eschew any sedentary pastimes. They
may jump, run, and play at ball; and music is highly suitable for
them. To beat them is a barbarism. This may indeed, sometimes
and perhaps, be necessary with boys ‘who are to follow mechanical
and servile arts,’ but not with those who are carefully brought up by
father and preceptor. Begin with encouragements to the well-behaved,
and admonitions to the naughty: and the severer punishments
should be ‘to shut him in; to withhold such food and other
things as he best likes, to take away his clothing, and so on; to
make him ponder long while over his misdoing.’ (This is singularly
gentle discipline for <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1430: indeed Palmieri intimates that
‘almost all people’ advocated manual correction in his time. Had
any other writer, of so early a date, discovered that ‘spare the rod
and spoil the child’ is not the sum-total of management for minors?)</p>

<p>A dinner-party is considered well made up, in point of numbers,
if the persons present are not less than three, nor more than nine.
A larger number than the latter cannot all join together in united
conversation.</p>

<p>‘The expenses of a munificent man should be in things that
bring honour and distinction; not private, but public—as in buildings,
and ornaments of churches, theatres, loggias, public feasts,
games, entertainments; and in such like magnificences he should
not compute nor reckon how much he spends, but by what means
the works may be to the utmost wonderful and ‘beautiful.’ (Nice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
doctrine this for some of our conscript fathers in England, whose
perennial diligence is, as Carlyle says, ‘preserving their game.’ But
the Florentine Republic was in that outcast condition that the
noblemen were not only not hereditary legislators, but were <i>ipso
facto</i> excluded from all public employment, unless they enrolled
themselves in the commonalty by belonging to one of the legislating
guilds.)</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading15">BALDASSAR CASTIGLIONE.</div>

<p>Both Pandolfini and Palmieri are authors of good repute in
Italian literature: but by no means equal to the writer next on our
list, Baldassar Castiglione, with his book named <i>The Courtier</i> (<i>Il
Cortigiano</i>). This is a remarkably choice example of Italian prose;
which is the more satisfactory because Castiglione was not a Tuscan,
but a Mantuan, and a proclaimed enemy of that narrow literary creed,
the palladium of pedants and ever-recurring bane of strong individualism
among Italian writers, that, save in the Florentine-Tuscan
language (or dialect) of the ‘<i>buon secolo</i>,’ the days of Petrarca
and Boccaccio, there is no orthodoxy of diction. Some noticeable
details on this point are to be found in the <i>Cortigiano</i>: showing
that the ultra-purists of that time insisted upon the use by writers,
whether Tuscan or belonging to other parts of Italy, of words occurring
in Petrarca and Boccaccio already quite obsolete and hardly intelligible
even in Tuscany—and also upon the use of corrupt forms
of words framed from the Latin, because these pertained to the
Tuscan idiom, even although correct forms of the same words were
in current use in other Italian regions. In all such regards Castiglione
claims for himself unfettered latitude of choice: the verbal
precisian, scared at his theoretic license, is surprised and relieved to
find that after all the book is not only endurable in style, even to
his own punctilious ears, but particularly elegant.</p>

<p>Baldassar Castiglione was born on the 6th of December 1478<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
at Casatico, in the Mantuan territory. Noble and handsome, he
grew up almost universally accomplished and learned; a distinguished
connoisseur; and valued by all the most eminent men of
his time. His full-length portrait appears in one of the frescoes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
Raphael in the Stanze of the Vatican. He went on many embassies—among
others, to England. Henry VIII., of whose youthful promise
he speaks in the most rapturous terms, knighted him: the Emperor
Charles V. said that by Castiglione’s death chivalry lost its brightest
luminary. His career closed at Toledo on the 2nd of February 1529.
Among his writings are poems in Latin and Italian, but his chief work
is the <i>Cortigiano</i>. This was composed between the years 1508 and
1518; and published in 1528, in a state which its author regarded as
somewhat hurried and incomplete. It is written in the narrative form,
but consisting principally of dialogue, or indeed of successive monologues;
and purports to relate certain <i>conversazioni</i> (rightly to be so
called) which were held in 1506 in the court of Urbino, for the delectation
of the Duchess Elisabetta della Rovere (by birth a Gonzaga)
and her ladies. The topic proposed for treatment is—what should a
perfectly qualified Courtier be like? The principal speakers on the
general subject are the Conte Lodovico da Canossa, Federico Fregoso,
and Ottavian Fregoso; Bernardo Bibiena takes up the special question
of <i>facetiæ</i>, and Giuliano de’ Medici speaks of the Court Lady, and
generally in honour of women.</p>

<p>The term Courtier has not a very exalted sound to a modern or
English ear: but Castiglione’s ideal Courtier is a truly noble and
gallant gentleman, furnished with all sorts of solid no less than
splendid qualities. His ultimate <i>raison d’être</i> is that he should
always, through good and evil report, tell his sovereign the strict
truth of all things which it behoves him to know—certainly a sufficiently
honourable and handsomely unfulfilled duty. The tone
throughout is lofty, and of more than conventional or courtly rectitude:<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
indeed, the book as a whole is hardly what one associates
mentally with the era of Pagan Popes,—of a Cæsar Borgia just cleared
off from Romagna, and an Alessandro de’ Medici impending over
Florence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading16">THE CORTIGIANO.</div>

<p>Almost the only illustration which Castiglione supplies of the art
of dining is the following anecdote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘The Marquis Federico of Mantua, father of our Lady Duchess,
being at table with many gentlemen, one of them, after he had eaten
a whole stew, said, “My Lord Marquis, pardon me;” and, so saying,
he began to suck up the broth that was left. Forthwith then said
the Marquis: “You should ask pardon of the pigs, for to me there
is no harm done at all!”’</p>
</div>

<p>Some other points I take as they come.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Having many a time reflected wherefrom Grace arises (not to
speak of those who derive it from the stars), I find one most universal
rule, which seems to me to hold good, in this regard, in all
human things done and said, more than aught else; and this is—to
avoid affectation as much as one can, and as a most bristling and
perilous rock, and (to use perhaps a new-coined word) to do everything
with a certain slightingness [<i>sprezzatura</i>], which shall conceal
art, and show that what is done and said comes to one without trouble
and almost without thinking.’ Yet there may be as much affectation
in slightingness itself as in punctilio. Instances adduced of the
latter, as regards the care of the person, are the setting a scrap of
looking-glass in a recess of one’s cap, and a comb in one’s sleeve, and
keeping a page to follow one perpetually about with a sponge and a
clothes-brush. Female affectations were ‘the plucking out the hair of
eyebrows and forehead, and undergoing all those inconveniences
which you ladies fancy to be altogether occult from men, and which
nevertheless are all known.’</p>

<p>The perfect Courtier ought to know music—sing at sight, and
play on various instruments; he ought also to have a practical knowledge
of drawing and painting. Better even than singing at sight is
singing solo to the viol, and most especially thus singing in recitative
[<i>per recitare</i>], ‘which adds to the words so much grace and force
that great marvel it is.’ All stringed instruments are well suited for
the Courtier; not so wind-instruments, ‘which Minerva interdicted to
Alcibiades, because they have an unseemly air.’ The Court Lady
also ought to have knowledge of letters, music, and painting, as well
as of dancing, and how to bear her part in entertainments [<i>festeggiare</i>].</p>

<p>‘Old men blame in us many things which, of themselves, are
neither good nor bad, but only because <i>they</i> used not to do them:
and they say that it is unbefitting for young men to go through the
city riding, especially on mules; to wear in the winter fur linings
and long robes; to wear a cap [<i>berretta</i>], at any rate until the man
has reached eighteen years of age,—and other the like things.
Wherein in sooth they mistake: for these customs, besides being convenient
and serviceable, are introduced by fashion, and universally
accepted,—as aforetime to dress in the open tunic [<i>giornea</i>], with open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
hose and polished shoes, and for gallantry to carry all day a hawk on
the fist for no reason, and to dance without touching the lady’s hand,
and to adopt many other modes which, as they would now be most
awkward, so then were they highly prized.’</p>

<p>Federico Fregoso, the chief speaker of the second evening, is of
opinion that a man of rank ought not to honour with his presence a
village feast, where the spectators and company would be coarse
people. To this Gaspar Pallavicino demurs; saying that, in his native
Lombardy, many young noblemen will dance all day under the sun
with country people, and play with them at wrestling, running, leaping,
and so on—exercises of strength and dexterity in which the
countrymen are often the winners. Fregoso rejoins that this, if done
at all, should be not by way of emulation but of complaisance, and
when the nobleman feels tolerably sure of conquering; and generally,
in all sorts of exercises save feats of arms, he should stop short of
anything like professional zeal or excellence. [A concluding hint
worth consideration in these days of ‘Athletic Clubs.’]</p>
</div>

<p>The discourse of Bernardo Bibiena on <i>facetiæ</i> is a magazine of good
things, both anecdotic, epigrammatic, and critical. The speaker is
particularly severe on ‘funny men’ and ‘jolly dogs’; concerning whom
I venture to introduce one consecutive extract of some little length.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘The Courtier should be very heedful of his beginnings,
so as to leave a pleasing impression, and should consider how
baneful and fatal it is to fall into the contrary. And this danger
do they more than others run who make it their business to be amusing,
and assume with these their quips a certain liberty authorizing
and licensing them to do and say whatever strikes them, without
any consideration. Thus these people start off on matters whence,
not knowing their way out again, they try to help themselves off by
raising a laugh: and this also they do so scurvily that it fails; so that
they occasion the severest tedium to those who see and hear them,
and they themselves remain most crestfallen. Sometimes, thinking
thus to be witty and lively, in the presence of ladies of honour, and
often even in speaking to them, they set-to at uttering most nasty and
indecent words: and, the more they see them blush, so much the
more do they account themselves good courtiers: and ever and anon
they laugh and plume themselves at so bright a gift which they think
their own. But for no purpose do they commit so many imbecilities
as in order to be thought “boon companions.” This is that only
name which appears to them worthy of praise, and which they vaunt
more than any other; and, to acquire it, they bandy the most blundering
and vile blackguardisms in the world. Often will they shove
one another down-stairs; knock ribs with bludgeons and bricks;
throw handfuls of dust into the eyes; and bring down people’s
horses upon them in ditches, or on the slope of a hill. Then, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
table, soups, sauces, jellies, all do they flop in one another’s face: and
then they laugh! And he who can do the most of these things accounts
himself the best and most gallant courtier, and fancies he has
gained great glory. And, if sometimes they invite a gentleman to
these their pleasantries, and he abstains from such horse-play, forthwith
they say that he makes himself too sage and grand, and is not a
“boon companion.” But worse remains to tell. There are some
who vie and wager which of them can eat and drink the most
nauseous and fetid things; and these they hunt up so abhorrent to
human senses that it is impossible to mention them without the utmost
disgust.—“And what may these be?” said Signor Lodovico
Pio.—Messer Federico replied: “Let the Marquis Febus [da Ceva]
tell you, as he has often seen them in France; and perhaps the thing
has happened to himself.”—The Marquis Febus replied: “I have
seen nothing of the sort done in France that is not also done in Italy.
But, on the other hand, what is praiseworthy in Italian habits of dress,
festivities, banqueting, fighting, and whatever else becomes a courtier,
is all derived from the French.”—“I deny not,” answered Messer
Federico, “that there are among the French also most noble and unassuming
cavaliers: and I for my part have known many truly worthy
of all praise. Yet some are to be found by no means well-bred: and,
speaking generally, it appears to me that the Spaniards get on better
in manner with the Italians than the French do; since that calm
gravity peculiar to the Spaniards seems to me much more conformable
to us than the rapid liveliness which is to be recognized almost in
every movement of the French race—which in them is not derogatory,
and even has grace, because to themselves it is so natural and appropriate
that it indicates no sort of affectation in them. There are indeed
many Italians who would fain force themselves to imitate that
manner; and they can manage nothing else than jogging the head in
speaking, and bowing sideways with a bad grace, and, when they are
walking about, going so fast that the grooms cannot keep up with
them. And with these modes they fancy they are good French
people, and partake of their offhand ways: a thing indeed which
seldom succeeds save with those who have been brought up in France,
and have got into these habits from childhood upwards.”</p>
</div>

<p>The reader will probably agree with me in thinking that Castiglione’s
own opinion is expressed here rather in the speech of Federico
Fregoso than of the Marquis Febus; and that the all-accomplished
Italian patrician of the opening sixteenth century by no means regarded
the French as the courteous nation <i>par excellence</i>. Elsewhere
it is remarked that the French recognize nobility in arms only, and
utterly despise letters and literary men; and that presumption is a
leading trait in the national character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>Castiglione does not seem to have entertained the same objection
to gesturing that Francesco da Barberino did. In amusing narration
or story-telling, at any rate, he approves of this accompaniment;
speaking of people who ‘relate and express so pleasantly something
which may have happened to them, or which they have seen or heard,
that with gestures and words they set it before your eyes, and make
you almost lay your hand upon it.’</p>

<p>The banefulness of a wicked Courtier is set forth in strong terms.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘No punishment has yet been invented horrid and tremendous enough
for chastising those wicked Courtiers who direct to a bad end their
elegant and pleasant manners and good breeding, and by these means
creep into the good graces of their sovereigns, to corrupt them, and
divert them from the path of virtue, and lead them into vice: for
such people may be said to infect with mortal poison, not a vessel
of which one only person has to drink, but the public fountain which
the whole population uses.’</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading17">GIOVANNI BATTISTA POSSEVINI.</div>

<p>The last two authors on our list, Giovanni Battista Possevini and
Giovanni della Casa, will bring us to about the middle of the sixteenth
century; beyond which I do not propose to pursue the subject
of Italian Courtesy-Books. We are now fairly out of the middle
ages, and in the full career of transition from the old to the new.
Indeed, were it not that Della Casa’s work, <i>Il Galateo</i>, is so peculiarly
apposite to our purpose, I might have been disposed to leave
both these writers aside as a trifle too modern in date: but, coming
closer as that does to the exact definition of a Courtesy-Book than any
other of the compositions which we have been considering, it must
perforce find admission here,—and a few words may at the same time
be spared to Possevini, who introduces us to a special department of
manners. And first of Possevini.</p>

<p>This writer was (like Castiglione) a Mantuan, and died young—perhaps
barely aged thirty. A famous man of letters, Paolo Giovio,
found him to be ‘a son of melancholy, and so learned, according to
the title of Christ on the cross,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> as to make one marvel: he is a good
poet.’ The book we have to deal with is of considerable size, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
<i>Dialogue concerning Honour</i> (<i>Dialogo dell’ Onore</i>): it was published
in 1553, after the author’s death, which seems to have occurred
towards 1550. Possevini is charged with having borrowed freely
from another writer, who devoted himself to the denunciation of
duelling, Antonio Bernardi; although indeed the <i>publication</i> of Bernardi’s
book did not take place till some years after the posthumous
work of Possevini was in print. The special subject of the latter,
as we have said, is honour—the quality and laws of honour, with a
leading though not exclusive reference to the duelling system.
Many other Italian writers of this period discussed that latter question,
some upholding and some reprobating the institution. Possevini
is certainly not one of its adversaries, but debates many of the ancillary
points with the particularity of a casuist. The few items which
I shall extract are cited more as curiosities than as fairly representing
the substance of the book.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading18">THE DIALOGO DELL’ ONORE.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A man of letters affronted by a military man is not—so Possevini
lays it down—bound to call him out, for the duel is not his vocation.
If he is depreciated in his literary character, it is in writing
that he should respond: if he is otherwise damnified, let him appeal
to the magistrate. But this latter course is not permitted to a soldier:
fighting is his business, and he must have recourse to the sword. The
maxim that, in duel, one is bound either to slay one’s adversary, or
take him prisoner, is barbarous: it should suffice to make him recant
or apologize, or to wound him, or to reduce him to surrender and
humiliation.</p>

<p>A man who marries a professional courtesan lowers himself; yet
not so far as that he can properly be refused as a duellist, or as a
magistrate, or in other matters pertaining to honour. A husband
who connives at his own dishonour, either by positive intention or by
stupidity exceeding a certain limit, should be refused as above; not
so a betrayed husband who has taken any ordinary precautions. The
husband who detects his wife in adultery, without resenting it, is a
dishonoured man: yet to kill her is beyond the mark,—to divorce her,
contrary to canon law. He should obtain a legal abrogation of the
wife’s dowry, or else, as a milder course, send her back to her own
people, and have no sort of knowledge of her thenceforth.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading19">GIOVANNI DELLA CASA.</div>

<p>Monsignor Giovanni della Casa, created Archbishop of Benevento
in 1544, was born of noble Florentine parentage on the 28th of
June 1503, and died on the 14th of November 1556. He ranks as
one of the best Latin and Italian poets of his century; but some of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
his poems are noted for licentiousness, and are even reputed to have
damaged his ecclesiastical career, and lost him a Cardinal’s hat.
The works thus impugned appear all to belong to his youth. He
had already obtained some church-preferment, and was settled in
Rome, by the year 1538. On the election of Pope Julius III., in
1550, Della Casa lived privately in the city or territory of Venice,
in great state, and distinguished for courteous and charitable
munificence. Paul IV., who succeeded to the papacy in 1555, recalled
him to Rome, and created him Secretary of State.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading20">THE GALATEO.</div>

<p>The <i>Galateo</i> (written, I presume, somewhere about 1550) has
always been a very famous book in Italy; and of that sort of fame
which includes great general as well as literary acceptance. It is a
model of strong sententious Tuscan; approaching the pedantic, yet
racily idiomatic at the same time. The title in full runs <i>Galateo, or
concerning Manners; wherein, in the Character of an Elderly Man
[Vecchio Idiota] instructing a Youth, are set forth the things which
ought to be observed and avoided in ordinary intercourse</i>. The
paragraphs are numbered, and amount to 180.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The name <i>Galateo</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
given to the book in consequence of a little anecdote which it introduces,
apparently from real life. There was once a Bishop of
Verona named Giovanni Matteo Giberti, noted for liberality. He
entertained at his house a certain Count Ricciardo—a highly accomplished
nobleman, but addicted (<i>proh pudor!</i>) to eating his victuals
with ‘an uncouth action of lips and mouth, masticating at table with
a novel noise very unpleasing to hear.’ The Bishop therefore deemed
it the kindest thing he could do to have the Count escorted on his
homeward way by a remarkably discreet, well-bred, and experienced
gentleman of the episcopal household, named Galateo, who wound
up a handsome compliment at parting with a plain exposition of the
guest’s peccadillo. His own misdoing was news to the Count: but
he took the information altogether in good part, and seriously promised
amendment.</p>

<p>Let us now dip into the <i>Galateo</i> for a few axioms; first on
dining, and afterwards on other points of manners.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>You must not smell at the wine-cup or the platter of any one,
not even at your own; nor hand the wine which you have tasted to
another, unless your very intimate friend; still less offer him any
fruit at which you have bitten. Some monsters thrust their snouts,
like pigs, into their broth, and never raise their eyes or hands from
the victuals, and gorge rather than eat with swollen cheeks, as if they
were blowing at a trumpet or a fire; and, soiling their arms almost
to the elbows, make a fearful mess of their napkins.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> And these
same napkins they will use to wipe off perspiration, and even to blow
their noses. You must not so soil your fingers as to make the
napkin nasty in wiping them: neither clean them upon the bread
which you are to eat: [we should hope not]. In company, and
most especially at table, you should not bully nor beat any servants;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
nor must you express anger, whatever may occur to excite it; nor
talk of any distressful matters—wounds, illnesses, deaths, or pestilence.
If any one falls into this mistake, the conversation should be
dexterously changed: ‘although, as I once heard said by a worthy
man our neighbour, people often would be as much eased by crying
as by laughing. And he affirmed that with this motive had the
mournful fictions termed tragedies been first invented: so that, being
set forth in theatres, as was then the practice, they might bring tears
to the eyes of those who had need of this, and thus they, weeping,
might be cured of their discomfort. But, be this as it may, for us it
is not befitting to sadden the minds of those with whom we converse,
especially on occasions when people have met for refreshment and
recreation, and not to cry: and, if any one languishes with a longing
to weep, right easy will it be to relieve him with strong mustard, or
to set him somewhere over the smoke.’ You should not scratch
yourself at table, nor spit; or, if spit you must, do it in a seemly
way. Some nations have been so self-controlling as not to spit at
all.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> ‘We must also beware of eating so greedily that hence comes
hiccupping or other disagreeable act; as he does who hurries so that
he has to puff and blow, to the annoyance of the whole company.’
Rub not your teeth with the napkin—still less with your fingers:
nor rinse out your mouth, nor spit forth wine. ‘Nor, on rising from
table, is it a nice habit to carry your toothpick<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> in your mouth, like
a bird which is in nest-building,—or behind the ear, like a barber.’
You must not hang the toothpick round your neck: it shows that
you are ‘overmuch prepared and provided for the service of the
gullet,’ and you might as well hang your spoon in the same way.
Neither must you loll on the table; nor by gesture or sound
symbolize your great relish of viands or wine—a habit fit only for
tavern-keepers and topers. Also you should not put people out of
countenance by pressing them to eat or drink.</p>

<p>‘To present to another something from the plate before oneself
does not seem to me well, unless he who presents is of much the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
higher grade, so that the recipient is thereby honoured. For, among
equals in condition, it looks as if he who offers the gift were setting
himself up somehow as the superior: and sometimes that which a
man gives is not to the taste of him it is given to. Besides, it
implies that the dinner has no abundance of dishes, or is not well
distributed, when one has too much, and another too little: and the
master of the house might take it as an affront. However, in this
one should do as others do, and not as it might be best to do in the
abstract: and in such fashions it is better to err along with others
than to be alone in well-doing. But, whatever may be the best
course in this, you must not refuse what is offered you; for it would
seem as if you slighted or reproved the donor.’</p>

<p>For one man to pledge another in the wine-cup is not an Italian
usage, nor yet rightly nationalized, and should be avoided. Decline
such an invitation; or confess yourself the worse drinker, and give
but one sip to your wine. ‘Thank God, among the many pests
which have come to us from beyond the mountains, this vilest one
has not yet reached us, of regarding drunkenness as not merely a
laughing-matter, but even a merit.’ The only time when you should
wash hands in company is before going to table: you should do it
then even though your hands be quite clean, ‘so that he who dips
with you into the same platter may know that for certain.’</p>

<p>Well-bred servitors, serving at table, must on no account scratch
their heads or any other part of the body, nor thrust their hands
anywhere under their clothes out of sight, but keep them ‘visible
and beyond all suspicion,’ and scrupulously clean. Those who
hand about plates or cups must abstain from spitting or coughing,
and most especially from sneezing. If a pear or bread has been
set to toast, the attendant must not blow off any ash-dust, but jog or
otherwise nick it off. He must not offer his pocket-handkerchief to
any one, though it be clean from the wash; for the person to whom
it is offered has no assurance of that fact, and may find it distasteful.
The usher must not take it upon himself to invite strangers, or to
retain them to dine with his lord: if he does so, no one who knows
his place will act on the invitation.</p>

<p>Scraping the teeth together, whistling, screaming, grinding stones,
and rubbing iron, are grievous noises: and a man who has a bad
voice should eschew singing, especially a solo. Coughing and
sneezing must not be done loud. ‘And there is also to be found
such a person as, in yawning, will howl and bray like an ass; and
another who, with his mouth still agape, <i>will</i> go on with his talk,
and emits that voice, or rather that noise, which a mute produces
when he tries to speak.’ Indeed, much yawning should be altogether
avoided: it shows that your company does not amuse you, and that
you are in a vacant mood. ‘And thus, when a man yawns among
others who are idle and unoccupied, all they, as you may often have
observed, yawn forthwith in response; as if the man had recalled to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
their memory the thing which they would have done before, if only
they had recollected it.’ Other acts discourteous to the company
you are in are—to fall asleep; to pace about the room, while others
are seated in conversation; to take a letter out of your pouch, and
read it; to set about paring your nails; or to hum between your
teeth, play the devil’s tattoo, or swing your legs. Also you must
not nudge a man with your elbow in talking to him. Let us have
no showing of tongue, nor overmuch stroking of beard, nor rubbing-together
of hands, nor heaving of long-drawn sighs, nor shaking
oneself up with a start, nor stretching, and singing-out of ‘Dear
me!’</p>

<p>Having used your pocket-handkerchief, don’t open it out to
inspect it.</p>

<p>‘They are in the wrong whose mouths are always full of their
babies, and their wife, and their nurse. “My little boy yesterday
made me laugh so—only hear.” “You never saw a sweeter child
than my Momus.” “My wife is so-and-so.” “Said Cecchina:<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and
could you ever believe it of such a scatterbrain?” There is no man
so unoccupied that he can either reply or attend to such nonsense:
and the speaker becomes a nuisance to everybody.’</p>

<p>In walking, you should not indulge in too much action, as by
sawing with your arms; nor should you stare other passers-by in the
face, as if there were some marvel there.</p>

<p>‘Now what shall I say of those who issue from the desk into
company with a pen behind the ear? or those who hold a handkerchief
in the mouth? or who lay one leg along the table? or who spit
on their fingers?’</p>

<p>Some people offend by affected humility, which is indeed a practical
lying. ‘With these the company has a bad bargain whenever
they come to a door; for they will for no consideration in the world
pass on first, but they step across, and return back,—and so fence and
resist with hands and arms that at every third step it becomes necessary
to battle with them, and this destroys all peace and comfort,
and sometimes the business which is in hand.’</p>
</div>

<p>This last caveat leads on the author to a passage of importance
regarding ceremoniousness in general; from which we learn that that
extreme of etiquette was still almost an innovation in Italy in the
middle of the sixteenth century, and contrary to the national bias.
This may surprise some readers; for certainly the courteous Italian
of the later period, for all his characteristic ‘naturalness,’ has not
been wanting in ceremony, and the elaboration of politeness of phrase
in his writing is something observable—at least to Englishmen, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
least ceremonious nation, I suppose, under heaven (and that is by no
means a term of disparagement). I subjoin the passage from Della
Casa, not a little condensed; followed by another, still more
abridged, concerning the essence and right of elegant manners.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘And therefore ceremonies (which we name, as you hear, by a
foreign word, as not having one of our own—which shows that our
ancestors knew them not, so that they could not give them any name)—ceremonies,
I say, differ little, to my thinking, from lies and dreams,
on account of their emptiness. As a worthy man has more than once
shown me, those solemnities which the clergy use in relation to altars
and the divine offices, and towards God and sacred things, are properly
called “ceremonies.” But, as soon as men began to reverence
one the other with artificial fashions beyond what is fitting, and to
call each other “master” and “lord,” bowing and cringeing and bending
in sign of reverence, and uncovering, and naming one another by
far-sought titles, and kissing hands, as if theirs were sacred like those
of priests,—somebody, as this new and silly usage had as yet no name,
termed it “ceremoniousness”: I think, by way of ridicule. Which
usage, beyond a doubt, is not native to us but foreign and barbarous,
and imported, whencesoever it be, only of late into Italy,—which,
unhappy, abased, and spiritless in her doings and influence, has
grown and gloried only in vain words and superfluous titles. Ceremonies,
then,—if we refer to the intention of those who practise
them—are a vain indication of honour and reverence towards the
person to whom they are addressed, set forth in words and shows,
and concerned with titles and proffers. I say “vain” in so far as we
honour in seeming those whom we hold in no reverence, and do sometimes
despise. And yet, that we may not depart from the customs of
others, we term them “Illustrissimo Signor” so-and-so, and “Eccellentissimo
Signor” such-a-one: and in like wise we sometimes profess
ourselves “most devoted servants” to some one whom we would
rather dis-serve than serve. This usage, however, it is not for us individually
to change—nay, we are compelled (as it is not our own
fault, but that of the time) to second it; but this has to be done with
discretion. Wherefore it is to be considered that ceremonies are
practised either for profit, or for vanity, or by obligation. And every
lie which is uttered for our own profit is a fraud and sin and a dishonest
thing (as indeed one cannot in any sort of case lie with
honour): and this sin do flatterers commit. And, if ceremonies are,
as we said, lies and false flatteries, whenever we practise them with a
view to gain we act like false and bad men: wherefore, with that
view, no ceremony ought to be practised. Those which are practised
by obligation must in no wise be omitted; for he who omits them is
not only disliked but injurious. And thus he who addresses a single
person as “<i>You</i>” (if it is not a person of the very lowest condition)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
does him no favour: nay, were he to say “<i>Thou</i>,” he would derogate
from his due, and act insultingly and injuriously, naming him by the
word which is usually reserved for poltroons and clodhoppers. And
these I call “ceremonies of obligation”: since they do not proceed
from our own will, nor freely of our own choice, but are imposed upon
us by the law—that is, by common usage. And he who is wont to
be termed “Signore” by others, and himself in like manner to address
others as “Signore,” assumes that you contemn him or speak
affrontingly when you call him simply by his name, or speak to him
as “Messere,” or blurt out a “<i>You</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> However, in these ceremonies
of obligation, certain points should be observed, so that one may not
seem either vain or haughty. And first, one should have regard to
the country one lives in; for every usage is not apposite in every
country. And perhaps that which is adopted by the Neapolitans,
whose city abounds in men of great lineage, and in barons of lofty
station, would not suit the Lucchese or Florentines, who for the most
part are merchants and simply gentlemen, having among them neither
princes nor marquises nor any baron. Besides this, regard must be
paid to the occasion, to the age and condition of the person towards
whom we practise ceremony, and to our own; and, with busy people,
one should cut them off altogether, or at any rate shorten them as
much as one can, and rather imply than express them: which the
courtiers in Rome are very expert in. Neither are men of great
virtue and excellence in the habit of practising many; nor do they
like or seek that many be practised towards them, not being minded to
waste much thought over futilities. Nor yet should artisans and persons
of low condition care to practise very elaborate ceremonies
towards great men and lords: for these rather than otherwise dislike
such demonstrations at their hands—for their way is to seek and
expect obedience more than civilities. And thus the servant who
proffers his service to his master makes a mistake: for the master
takes it amiss, and esteems that the servant wants to call in question
his mastership,—as if his right were not to dictate and command. If
you show a little suitable abundance of politeness to those who are
your inferiors, you will be called courteous. And, if you do the
same to your superiors, you will be termed well-bred and agreeable.
But he who should in this matter be excessive and profuse would be
blamed as vain and frivolous; and perhaps even worse would befall
him, for he might be held evil and sycophantic. And this is the
third kind of ceremonies, which does indeed proceed from our will,
and not from usage. Let us then recollect that ceremonies (as I said
from the first) were naturally not necessary,—on the contrary, people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
got on perfectly well without them: as our own nation, not long ago,
did almost wholly. But the illnesses of others have infected us also
with this and many other infirmities. For which reasons, when we
have submitted to usage, all the residue in this matter that is superfluous
is a kind of licit lying: or rather, from that point onwards, not
licit but forbidden—and therefore a displeasing and tedious thing to
noble souls, which will not live on baubles and appearances. Vain
and elaborate and superabundant ceremonies are flatteries but little
covert, and indeed open and recognized by all. But there is another
sort of ceremonious persons who make an art and trade of this, and
keep book and document of it. To such a class of persons, a giggle;
and to such another, a smile. And the more noble shall sit upon
the chair, and the less noble upon the settle. Which ceremonies I
think were imported from Spain into Italy. But our country has
given them a poor reception, and they have taken little root here;
for this so punctilious distinction of nobility is a vexation to us:<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and
therefore no one ought to set himself up as judge, to decide who is
more noble, and who less so.—To speak generally, ceremoniousness
annoys most men; because by it people are prevented from living in
their own way—that is, prevented from liberty, which every man
desires before all things else.’</p>

<p>‘Agreeable manners are those which afford delight, or at least do
not produce any vexation, to the feelings, appetite, or imagination,
of those with whom we have to do. A man should not be content
with doing that which is right, but should also study to do it with
grace. And grace [<i>leggiadria</i>] is as it were a light which shines
from the fittingness of things that are well composed and well
assorted the one with the other, and all of them together; without
which measure even the good is not beautiful, and beauty is not
pleasurable. Therefore well-bred persons should have regard to this
measure, both in walking, standing, and sitting, in gesture, demeanour,
and clothing, in words and in silence, and in rest and in
action.’</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="heading21">THE TRATTATO DEGLI UFFICI COMUNI.</div>

<p>Besides the <i>Galateo</i>, Monsignor della Casa has left another and
shorter <i>Tractate on Amicable Intercourse between Superiors and
Inferiors</i> (<i>Trattato degli Uffici Comuni tra gli Amici Superiori e
Inferiori</i>). This deals not so much with the relation between
those who are rich and those who are poor in the gifts of
fortune, taken simply on that footing, as with the connection between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
master and servant, patron and client, magnate and dependent. The
tone is grave and humane, with an adequate share of worldly wisdom
interspersed. The opening is interesting and suggestive; and shows
that the great ‘Servant Controversy,’ of which the pages of English
daily newspapers are now almost annually conscious in the dull season,
was by no means unknown to Italy in the sixteenth century:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I apprehend that the ancients were free from a great and continual
trouble; having their households composed, not of free men,
as is our usage, but of slaves, of whose labour they availed themselves,
both for the comforts of life, and to maintain their repute,
and for the other demands of society. For, as the nature of
man is noble, copious, and erect, and far more apt to commanding
than obeying, a hard and odious task do those undertake who
assume to exercise masterdom over it, while still bold and of undiminished
strength, as is done now-a-days. To the ancients, in my
judgment, it was no difficult or troublesome thing to command those
who were already quelled and almost domesticated—people whom
either chains, or long fatigues, or a soul servile from very childhood,
had bereaved of pride and force. We on the contrary have to do
with souls robust, spirited, and almost unbending; which, through
the vigour of their nature, refuse and hate to be in subjection, and,
knowing themselves free, resist their masters, or at least seek and
demand (often with reason, but sometimes also without) that in commanding
them some measure be observed. Whence it arises that
every house is full of complaints, wranglings, and questionings. And
certainly this is the fact; because we are unjust judges in our own
cause,—and, as it is true that everybody unfairly prizes his own
affairs higher than those of others, albeit of equal value, and consequently
always persuades himself that he has given more than he
has received, the thing cannot go on <i>pari passu</i>. Hence comes the
wearisome complaint of the one, “I have worn myself out in your
house;” and the rebuke of the other, “I have maintained and fed
you, and treated you well.”’</p>
</div>

<p>I can afford only one more extract from this treatise; which indeed
handles its general subject-matter more on the ground of fairness,
good-feeling, and expedient compromise of conflicting claims, than
as a question of courtesy—though neither is that left out of view.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘In giving orders and assigning duties which have to be fulfilled,
let regard be paid to the condition of the individuals; so that,
if anything uncleanly is to be done, that be allotted to the lowest,
and it come not to pass (as some perverse-natured people will have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
it) that noblemen<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> should sweep the house, and carry slops out of
the chambers. Let not things of much labour be committed to the
weak, nor the degrading to the well-mannered, nor the frivolous and
sportful to the aged. Moreover let the masters be heedful not to
impose upon any one anything of uncommon difficulty or labour or
painstaking, unless of necessity or for some great cause; for the laws
of humanity command us not to make a call upon a man’s diligence
and solicitude beyond what is reasonable, or as if in levity—especially
if it exceeds the ordinary bounds.’</p>
</div>

<p>With this I shut up Della Casa’s volume, and take final leave of
my reader—trusting that, after perusing, skimming, or skipping, so
much matter concerning Courtesy, he will part from me on the terms
of (at lowest) a ‘courteous reader,’ in more than the merely conventional
sense.</p>

<p class="noindent">This phrase is not quite clear to me; but I suppose the word ‘<i>arti</i>’ is to be

<p class="noindent">I have translated literally; but that of course makes something very like nonsense
in English. To ‘make the fig’ is a gesture of the thumb and fingers,
understood as gross and insulting in the highest degree. The general sense of
the passage is therefore—‘He fancies he is thus testifying in his own honour,
whereas it really does redound to his own extreme shame.’ Readers of Dante,

will perceive that the illustrious pupil had been to a great extent anticipated
by the teaching of his early instructor. Francesco da Barberino
(<i>Reggimento e Costumi delle Donne</i>) adopts a middle course, discriminating
‘<i>gentilezza</i>’ thus: ‘Nobility is twoform in quality and in origin. The first is
a state of the human soul contented in virtue, hostile to vice, exulting in the
good of others, and pitiful in their adversity. The second is mastery over
men or riches, derived from of old, sensitive to shame when brought low.’</p>

it would seem that Brunetto does not mean to recommend connivance with
anything that is positively evil, but only with current habits and fashions, objectionable
though they may be, in matters essentially indifferent—as of
speech and deportment.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> ‘<i>Solo d’una canzone</i>:’ literally, ‘merely for one song.’ The Abate Zannoni
understands this to mean ‘<i>per aver una sola volta canzonato femmina</i>.’
He admits that this sense of the phrase is not discoverable in that fetish of the
Italian pedant, the Dizionario della Crusca; but as I have no superior authority
to oppose to that of Abate Zannoni, I have followed his interpretation.</p>

with married women.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> ‘Afresh’ represents the Italian ‘de frescho.’ Signor Biondelli considers
that the phrase means ‘afresh,’ indicating that Fra Bonvesino had written
his Courtesies in Latin before turning them into Italian. Signor Biondelli,
however, admits that ‘de frescho’ may also mean ‘now recently,’ ‘just now’;
and, but for his contrary preference, I should attribute that meaning to the
word in the present instance.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> ‘Noxe.’ I <i>suppose</i> this must represent the modern-Italian word ‘nozze,’

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> Signor Biondelli understands this stanza in a somewhat different sense, as
applying to the <i>assigning</i> of dishes, not the <i>signing</i> of the cross as a grace before

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> It is clear from the general context that the victuals here spoken of as
to be eaten with a spoon are solid edibles—not merely soups or the like: the
spoon corresponding to the modern fork. The word translated ‘suck’ is ‘sorbilar:’
perhaps ‘mumble’ would convey the force of the precept more fully
though less literally.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> This appears to be the general sense of the last two lines. In the final one

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> This seems to contemplate the plan of the several guests helping themselves
off the dish brought to table. At any rate, so Signor Biondelli understands
it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> ‘Donzello.’ This precept seems to be especially addressed to the servitors.
Uguccione Pisano, quoted by Muratori, says: ‘Donnicelli et Domicellæ dicuntur
quando pulchri juvenes magnatum sunt sicut servientes.’ Such Donzelli
were not allowed to sit at table with the knights; or, if allowed, had to sit
apart on a lower seat.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> ‘Drapi da pey.’ I confess to some uncertainty as to what sort of thing
these ‘foot-cloths’ may have been. Signor Biondelli terms them ‘the cloths
wherewith the feet were wrapped round and dried.’ He adds: ‘This precept
apprizes us that at that time the use of a pocket-handkerchief was not yet
introduced, and perhaps not even the use of stockings.’ One would fain hope
that the summit of Lombardic good breeding in 1290 was not the wiping of
noses on cloths actually and at the moment serving for the feet. Possibly
<i>drapi da pey</i> is here a generic term; cloths or napkins at hand for use, and
which <i>might have</i> served for foot-cloths. Thus the word ‘duster’ might be
employed in a similar connection, without our being compelled to suppose that
the individual duster had first been used on the spot for dusting the tables or
floors, and then for wiping the nose. Or indeed, we moderns, who wipe our
noses on <i>hand</i>-kerchiefs, do not first use said kerchiefs for wiping our <i>hands</i>,
nor yet for <i>covering our heads</i> (‘<i>couvre chef</i>’).—Reverting to Signor Biondelli’s
observation as to ‘the use of stockings,’ I may observe that Francesco da Barberino,
in a passage of his <i>Reggimento e Costumi delle Donne</i>, speaks of ‘the
beautiful foot shod in silk’—‘<i>calzato in seta</i>’—which <i>may</i> imply either a
stocking or else a shoe. This poem, as we shall see further on, is but little
later than Bonvicino’s.—The reader may also observe, at <a href="#Page_68">p. 68</a>, the horror with
which a much later writer, Della Casa, contemplated the use of a dinner-napkin
as a pocket-handkerchief.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> ‘Chi s’ asetilia.’ Signor Biondelli cannot assign the exact sense of this
verb. I should suppose it to be either a form of ‘Assettarsi,’ to settle oneself,
to keep one’s place, or a corruption of ‘Assottigliarsi,’ to subtilize, to be punctilious,
to ‘look sharp.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> ‘D’alchun obediente.’ This phrase, if directly connected with the ‘Jesu
Xristo’ of the previous line, seems peculiar. I am not quite clear whether
the whole stanza is to be understood as an injunction to render grace after
meat, in thankfulness for what Christ has given one—or to thank the <i>servants</i>
who have been waiting at table, and so to glorify Christ by an act of humility.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> ‘Dro bon vino dra carera.’ The general sense is evidently near what
the translation gives: but Signor Biondelli is unable to assign the <i>precise</i> sense.
No wonder therefore that I am unable.</p>

<i>first</i> studies under Brunetto Latini. <i>Hence he passed</i> to the Universities of
Padua and of Bologna.’ Barberino being a Tuscan, this seems the natural
course for him to adopt, rather than to have gone to Padua and Bologna
<i>before</i> Florence. My brother’s remark, as to the death of Neri in 1296, and
as to Francesco’s <i>subsequent</i> sojourn in Florence, agrees, however, with the
statement made by Tiraboschi: apparently we should understand that Francesco
had been in Florence both before and after his stay in Padua and
Bologna, and that his studies under Brunetto pertain to the earlier period.</p>

of less account, would seem to show that at this period the seats at the right
and left of the host (or hostess) were by no means understood to be posts
of honour. The absence of all mention, either in Bonvicino or in Barberino,
of the hostess or her especial duties, strikes one as a singularity. That the
hostess is nevertheless understood to be present may be fairly inferred from
the clearly expressed presence of other ladies.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> The mention of a slave in a Florentine household of the late 13th or
early 14th century may startle some readers. I translate the note which
Signor Guglielmo Manzi, the editor of the <i>Reggimento</i>, supplies on this subject.
‘Slavery, which abases mankind, and revolts humanity and reason,
diminished greatly when the Christian religion was introduced into the Roman
Empire—that religion being in manifest opposition to so barbarous a system.
The more the one progressed in the world, the more did the other wane; and,
as Bodino observes in his book <i>De Republicâ</i>, slavery had ceased in Europe, to
a great extent, by 1200. I shall follow this author, who is the only one to
afford us some degree of light amid so great obscurity. In the year 1212
there were still, according to him, slaves in Italy; as may be seen from the
ordinances of William, King of Sicily, and of the Emperor Frederick II. for
the kingdom of Naples, and from the decretals of the Popes Alexander III.,
Urban III., and Innocent III., concerning the marriages of slaves. The first
of these Popes was elected in 1158, the second in 1185, and the third in 1198;
so that the principle of liberty cannot be dated earlier than in or about 1250—Bartolo,
who lived in the year 1300, writing (<i>Hostes de Captivis</i>, I.) that in his
time there were no slaves, and that, according to the laws of Christendom,
men were no longer put up to sale. This assertion, however, conflicts with the
words of our author, who affirms that in his time—that is, at the commencement
of the 14th century—the custom existed. But, in elucidation of Bartolo,
it should be said that he implied that men were no longer sold, on the
ground that this was prohibited by the laws of Christendom, and the edicts of
sovereigns. In France it can be shown that in 1430 Charles VII. gave their
liberty to some persons of servile condition; and even in the year 1548 King
Henri II. liberated, by letters patent, those of the Bourbonnais: and the like
was done throughout all his states by the Duke of Savoy in 1561. In the
Hundred Tales of Boccaccio we have also various instances showing that the
sale of free men was practised in Italy. These are in the 6th Tale of the 2nd
Day, the story of Madonna Beritola, whose sons remained in Genoa in serfdom;
and in the 6th of the 5th Day, the story of Frederick, King of Sicily;
and in the 7th of the same Day, the story of Theodore and Violante. It is
therefore clear, from all this evidence, that, in the time of Messer Francesco,
so execrable a practice was still prevalent; and, summing up all we have said,
it must be concluded that serfdom, in non-barbarian Europe, was not entirely
extinguished till the 16th century.’</p>

‘giullari,’ jesters, and buffoons: and in process of time it came to include
courtiers of whatever class. In the early writers—such as Barberino, Boccaccio,
&amp;c.—it is not always easy for a translator to pitch upon the precise
equivalent: the reader should understand a personage who might be as
romantic as a Troubadour, or as quaint as a Touchstone—but tending rather
towards the latter extreme.</p>

these were objected to on moral or rather on ecclesiastical grounds I cannot
affirm: the book as now printed is not only quite free from immoralities, but
is decidedly moral, whereas there remains at least one passage of a tone such
as churchmen resent <i>ex officio</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_52" href="#FNanchor_52" class="label">[52]</a> That most capital and characteristic book, the Autobiography of the
tragedian Alfieri, contains a reference to the <i>Galateo</i>, which, longish as it is,
I am tempted to extract. ‘My worthy Paciaudi was wont to advise me not
to neglect, amid my laborious readings, works in prose, which he learnedly
termed the nurse of poetry. As regards this, I remember that one day he
brought me the <i>Galateo</i> of Della Casa; recommending me to ponder it well
with respect to the turn of speech, which assuredly is pure Tuscan, and the
reverse of all Frenchifying. I, who in boyhood had (as we all have) read it
loosely, understood it little, and relished it not at all, felt almost offended at
this schoolboyish and pedantic advice. Full of venom against the said
<i>Galateo</i>, I opened it. And, at the sight of that first <i>Conciossiacosachè</i>, to
which is trailed-on that long sentence so pompous and so wanting in pith, such
an impulse of rage seized me that, hurling the book out of window, I cried
like a maniac: “Surely a hard and disgusting necessity, that, in order to
write tragedies at the age of twenty-seven, I must swallow down again this
childish chatter, and relax my brain with such pedantries!” He smiled at
my uneducated poetic <i>furor</i>; and prophesied that I would yet read the
<i>Galateo</i>, and that more than once. And so it turned out; but several years
afterwards, when I had thoroughly hardened my neck and shoulders to bear
the grammatical yoke. And I read not only the <i>Galateo</i>, but almost all our
prose writers of the fourteenth century, and annotated them too: with what
profit I cannot say. But true it is that, were any one to give them a good
reading as regards their turn of phrase, and to manage availing himself with
judgment and skill of their array, rejecting the cast clothes of their ideas, he
might perhaps afterwards, in his writings as well philosophic as poetic or
historic, or of any other class, give a richness, brevity, propriety, and force of
colour, to his style, which I have not as yet seen fully gracing any Italian
writer.’ A word or two may be spared to the formidable-looking vocable
<i>Conciossiacosachè</i> which so excited Alfieri’s bile. It might be translated
literally as ‘Herewith-be-something-that;’ and corresponds in practice to the
English ‘Forasmuch as’—or more briefly ‘since,’ or ‘as.’ The Italian word
<i>poichè</i> serves all the same uses, save that of longwindedness. But <i>Conciossiacosachè</i>
itself is not lengthy enough for some Italian lips: and I believe
that even the phrase into which it has sometimes been prolonged—‘Con ciò
sia cosa fosse massimamente che’—has been used for other than burlesquing
purposes.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55" class="label">[55]</a> <i>Stecco.</i> ‘Toothpick’ is the only appropriate technical sense for stecco
given in the dictionaries; and I suppose it is correct here, although Della
Casa’s very next sentence, denouncing the carrying of this implement round the
neck, designates it by the word <i>stuzzicadenti</i>, and it seems odd that the two
terms should be thus juxta-posed or opposed. If <i>stecco</i> does not in this passage
really mean ‘toothpick,’ I should infer that it indicates some skewer-like
object, used possibly as a fork—i.e. to secure the viands on the plate, while
they are severed with a spoon, and by that conveyed to the mouth (see pp. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>
and <a href="#Page_34">34</a> as to the use of spoon instead of fork in Bonvicino’s time). This would
in fact be a sort of chop-stick. Such an inference is quite compatible with
